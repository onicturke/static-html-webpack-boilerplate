In this article, we will show you how to use FastCAM510 for cutting steel plate and structural components in four easy steps:
 
1. Create or import your part drawings using FastCAM Drawing Editor or FastBEAM Editor. You can draw your own parts using the built-in CAD tools, or import existing CAD files in CAM, DXF, DWG, NC1 or PDF formats. You can also edit and modify your drawings as needed.
2. Path your parts using FastCAM Pathing. You can assign cutting parameters such as kerf width, lead-in/out, pierce height and speed for each part. You can also optimize your paths to reduce cutting time and avoid collisions.
3. Nest your parts using FastCAM Nesting. You can choose from different nesting methods such as rectangular, true shape or common line nesting. You can also specify your stock size, orientation, spacing and edge allowance. You can preview and edit your nests before generating NC code.
4. Cut your parts using FastCAM Cutting. You can send your NC code directly to your cutting machine via RS232 or network connection. You can also save your NC code as a file for later use or transfer. You can monitor and control your cutting process using the graphical interface.
