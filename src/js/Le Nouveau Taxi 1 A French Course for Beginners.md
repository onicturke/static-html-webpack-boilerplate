If you are looking for a free download of the DVD-ROM, you may be disappointed to find out that it is not legally available online. The only way to get the DVD-ROM is to buy the book or borrow it from a library. However, you can still find some resources online that can help you learn French with Le Nouveau Taxi 1.
 
One of them is the Internet Archive, which has a digital copy of the book that you can read online or download for free[^1^]. You can also find the audio files for the book on SoundCloud[^2^], which you can listen to online or download as mp3 files. Another option is to use a website like npm[^3^], which has a link to a torrent file that claims to have the DVD-ROM. However, this is not a legal or safe way to get the DVD-ROM, and we do not recommend it.
 
Le Nouveau Taxi 1 is a great way to start learning French, but you need to have access to the DVD-ROM to get the most out of it. If you cannot afford to buy the book or find it in a library, you may want to look for other alternatives that are more accessible and affordable online.
