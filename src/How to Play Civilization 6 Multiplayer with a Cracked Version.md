## What is a steamworks fix?
 
A steamworks fix is a file that enables multiplayer support for cracked games via Steam. It works by emulating Steam's online features and allowing you to join or host games with other players who have the same fix. You need to have Steam installed and running on your computer, but you don't need to own the game on Steam.
 
## What is an updater?
 
An updater is a program that downloads and installs the latest updates and DLCs for cracked games. It helps you keep your game version up to date and compatible with other players who have the same version. You need to have the base game installed on your computer before using an updater.

To play Civilization 6 multiplayer with a cracked version, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the base game from a reliable source, such as [Ova Games](https://www.ovagames.com/). Make sure it is the CODEX release, which has the file name codex-sid.meiers.civilization.vi.rise.and.fall.iso.
2. Mount or extract the ISO file and install the game on your computer.
3. Go to [this link](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=72061) and download the latest updater for Civilization 6. Run the updater and select the folder where you installed the game. Wait for it to download and install the updates and DLCs.
4. Go to [this link](https://online-fix.me/games/strategy/16273-sid-meiers-civilization-vi-po-seti.html) and download the latest steamworks fix for Civilization 6. Extract the files and copy them to the folder where you installed the game. Replace any existing files if prompted.
5. Launch Steam and log in with your account. You don't need to own Civilization 6 on Steam, but you need to have it in your library. You can add it as a non-Steam game by clicking on Games > Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library.
6. Launch Civilization 6 from Steam or from the game folder. You should see a green icon next to your name in Steam, indicating that you are playing Civilization 6.
7. To join or host a multiplayer game, go to Multiplayer > Internet. You should see a list of available games hosted by other players who have the same fix. You can also create your own game by clicking on Host Game and inviting your friends who have the same fix.

That's it! You can now enjoy playing Civilization 6 multiplayer with your friends using a cracked version of the game. Remember to always use a VPN when playing online games with cracked versions, as it can protect your privacy and security from potential risks.
