Sound drivers also affect the quality and performance of your sound. If you have outdated or corrupted sound drivers, you may experience problems such as low volume, distorted sound, crackling noise, or no sound at all. To avoid these issues, you should always keep your sound drivers updated and compatible with your operating system and hardware.
